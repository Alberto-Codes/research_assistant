# Research Agent: Project Status

## What is this project?

Research Agent is a tool designed to help users perform structured research tasks more effectively. Built on a foundation called "pydantic-graph", the project demonstrates how to create intelligent workflows that can be customized for various research needs.

Think of it as a pipeline where information flows through different stations (or "nodes"), each station performing a specific task, and together they create a complete research process.

## Current Status

### What Works Now

- **Core Functionality**: The system is fully operational, with a "Hello World" example that demonstrates the pipeline structure.
- **Graph System**: Successfully implemented using the `pydantic-graph` library (version 0.0.30).
- **Multiple Interfaces**: Users can interact with the tool through:
  - Command-line interface (for technical users)
  - Web interface built with Streamlit (for visual interaction)
- **Node Structure**: Properly implemented nodes (HelloNode, WorldNode, CombineNode, PrintNode) with clean execution flow.
- **State Management**: Robust implementation for passing state between nodes with detailed tracking.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error detection and reporting throughout the node execution process.
- **Testing Framework**: Comprehensive tests ensure the system works as expected.
- **Code Quality Tools**: We've implemented several tools to maintain high code quality.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Users can customize certain aspects of how the system works.

### Recent Improvements

- **Fixed entry point issues**: Corrected the entry point in `setup.py` to use `cli_entry` instead of `main` for proper async execution.
- **Resolved node implementation conflicts**: Removed duplicate `HelloNode` class definition in `services.py` that was causing conflicts.
- **Enhanced error detection**: Added validation in the `_measure_execution_time` decorator to catch invalid node return types.
- **Improved dependency handling**: Added fallback imports and better error handling for optional dependencies.
- **Streamlined services layer**: Refactored the API services to use the core implementations more effectively.
- Added comprehensive test coverage for all components
- Implemented static code analysis tools (linters, formatters)
- Created a Makefile to simplify common development tasks
- Developed a cleanup script to maintain code quality
- Streamlined the Streamlit web interface for better user experience

### Recent Updates

### Integrations

- **Vertex AI Integration**: Added support for Google Vertex AI through Pydantic-AI's VertexAIModel, providing a reliable and efficient way to call Google's Gemini models.

- **Pydantic-AI Integration**: Replaced direct Google Cloud API calls with Pydantic-AI's VertexAI integration, simplifying authentication and error handling.

### Known Limitations

- The current implementation uses mock LLM (Large Language Model) clients instead of connecting to real AI services
- The research capabilities are limited to the "Hello World" example
- Performance optimizations for larger workloads haven't been implemented yet

## Execution Flow

The application follows this execution path:
1. Entry point (`cli_entry`) is called through the command-line
2. Command parsing and setup is handled in `commands.py`
3. The service layer (`services.py`) is called to run the graph
4. The graph executes through a series of nodes:
   - `HelloNode` generates "Hello" text
   - `WorldNode` generates "World" text
   - `CombineNode` combines the texts
   - `PrintNode` outputs the result
5. Results are displayed with detailed timing information

## What's Next?

### Short-term Goals

- Connect to real LLM providers (like OpenAI, Anthropic) for more powerful capabilities
- Add more complex research workflows beyond the example
- Improve documentation for non-technical users
- Create tutorials to help users build their own research agents

### Long-term Vision

- Develop specialized research agents for different domains (academic research, market analysis, etc.)
- Build a library of reusable components for common research tasks
- Create a visual builder for constructing custom research workflows
- Implement advanced features like memory, self-correction, and learning from feedback

## Getting Started

If you're interested in trying the Research Agent:

1. **For non-technical users**: The easiest way is to use the Streamlit interface by running:
   ```
   make run-ui
   ```
   This opens a web page where you can interact with the system visually.

2. **For developers**: Check out the README.md file for detailed setup instructions.

3. **Quick test**: To verify the installation, run the command-line tool:
   ```
   research_agent
   ```
   This should produce a "Hello World!" output with detailed execution information.

## How You Can Help

- **Testing**: Try the application and report any issues you encounter
- **Feedback**: Share ideas for improving the user experience
- **Use cases**: Suggest real-world research scenarios that would be valuable to implement
- **Documentation**: Help improve explanations for non-technical users

## Project Health

The project is in a **stable and functioning state**. The codebase follows best practices for Python development, and we're committed to maintaining high code quality standards. All tests are currently passing, and the system is ready for further enhancement beyond the "Hello World" example.

The latest build (`research_agent-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl`) is available and functioning correctly with all recent fixes applied.
