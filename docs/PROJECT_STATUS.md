# Research Agent: Project Status

## What is this project?

Research Agent is a tool designed to help users perform structured research tasks more effectively. Built on a foundation called "pydantic-graph", the project demonstrates how to create intelligent workflows that can be customized for various research needs.

Think of it as a pipeline where information flows through different stations (or "nodes"), each station performing a specific task, and together they create a complete research process.

## Current Status

### What Works Now

- **Core Functionality**: The system is fully operational, with a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system that demonstrates the pipeline structure for document-based query answering.
- **Graph System**: Successfully implemented using the `pydantic-graph` library (version 0.0.30).
- **Multiple Interfaces**: Users can interact with the tool through:
  - Command-line interface (for technical users)
  - Web interface built with Streamlit (for visual interaction)
  - Gemini Chat interface with streaming responses
- **Node Structure**: Properly implemented nodes (QueryNode, RetrieveNode, AnswerNode, ChromaDBIngestionNode) with clean execution flow.
- **State Management**: Robust implementation for passing state between nodes with detailed tracking.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error detection and reporting throughout the node execution process.
- **Testing Framework**: Comprehensive tests ensure the system works as expected.
- **Code Quality Tools**: We've implemented several tools to maintain high code quality.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Users can customize certain aspects of how the system works.
- **Document Ingestion**: ChromaDB integration for document storage and retrieval with vector embeddings.

### Known Limitations

- Limited document format support (primarily text files) without advanced document understanding capabilities
- Performance optimizations for larger workloads haven't been implemented yet

## Execution Flow

The application follows this execution path:
1. Entry point (`cli_entry`) is called through the command-line
2. Command parsing and setup is handled in `main.py`
3. The appropriate command handler (from the `commands/` directory) is called
4. The service layer (`services.py`) is called to run the graph
5. The graph executes through nodes and returns results
6. Results are displayed with detailed timing information

For the Gemini CLI interface, the flow is:
1. User runs `research_agent gemini --prompt "Your question here"`
2. The `commands/gemini.py` module handles the command and configures logging
3. The service layer is called to generate an AI response
4. The response and timing information are displayed to the user

For the Document Ingestion pipeline, the flow is:
1. User runs `research_agent ingest --data-dir "./data" --collection "my_docs"`
2. The `commands/ingest.py` module parses arguments and loads documents
3. Documents are processed and embedded using ChromaDB
4. The ingestion results are displayed with timing and document counts

For the Gemini Chat interface, the flow is:
1. Entry point (`cli_entry --app gemini`) launches the Streamlit interface
2. Streamlit renders the chat UI with configuration options in the sidebar
3. User inputs are processed through the Gemini agent
4. Responses are streamed in real-time to the UI
5. Conversation history is maintained and can be exported

## What's Next?

### Short-term Goals

- Complete the RAG integration by adding CLI and UI integration points

- Implement file upload capabilities for document analysis in the chat interface
- Integrate Docling for advanced document processing and wider format support

### Long-term Vision

- Develop specialized research agents for different domains (academic research, market analysis, etc.)
- Build a library of reusable components for common research tasks
- Create a visual builder for constructing custom research workflows
- Implement advanced features like memory, self-correction, and learning from feedback
- Integrate multimodal capabilities for image and audio processing

## Getting Started

If you're interested in trying the Research Agent:

1. **For the multi-page Streamlit interface**:
   ```
   python -m src.main ui
   ```
   This opens a web application with multiple features:
   - **Chat with Gemini**: Have conversations with the Gemini model
   - **Document Ingestion**: Upload and manage documents in ChromaDB

2. **To use the Gemini CLI command**:
   ```
   research_agent gemini --prompt "Your question here"
   ```
   This directly sends a single prompt to the Gemini model and displays the response in the terminal.
   
   Additional options:
   ```
   research_agent gemini --prompt "Your question" --log-level DEBUG --project-id your-project-id
   ```

3. **To ingest documents from the command line**:
   ```
   research_agent ingest --data-dir "./data" --collection "my_collection" --chroma-dir "./chroma_db"
   ```
   This loads documents from the specified directory and stores them in a ChromaDB collection.

4. **For the streamlit UI with a specific port**:
   ```
   python -m src.main ui --port 8888
   ```
   This launches the Streamlit interface on port 8888 instead of the default 8501.

5. **For developers**: Check out the README.md file for detailed setup instructions.

6. **Quick test**: To verify the installation, run the command-line tool:
   ```
   research_agent gemini --prompt "Hello, what can you do?"
   ```
   This should produce a detailed response from the Gemini model.

## Project Health

The project is in a **stable and functioning state**. The codebase follows best practices for Python development, and we're committed to maintaining high code quality standards. All tests are now passing with the recent pydantic-graph integration fixes, and the system is ready for further enhancement beyond the "Hello World" example.

The latest build (`research_agent-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl`) is available and functioning correctly with all recent fixes applied.

The CLI structure has been significantly improved with a modular architecture that makes it easy to add new commands in the future. The document ingestion pipeline is now fully operational with ChromaDB integration, allowing for storage and retrieval of document embeddings. The logging system provides detailed information for debugging and monitoring, with configurable output levels and destinations.

The Gemini Chat interface is now fully operational with streaming responses and robust async handling, making it suitable for interactive research and exploration tasks. The interface has been significantly improved with a complete rewrite of the streaming implementation, fixing event loop issues that previously prevented multi-turn conversations. The codebase has been streamlined to use exclusively the GeminiLLMClient, removing unnecessary client implementations and simplifying the architecture. The Graph implementation has been properly aligned with pydantic-graph's requirements, ensuring a solid foundation for future development of more complex research workflows. 

The main entry points have been consolidated to eliminate redundancy and improve maintainability. The `src/main.py` file now serves as the single source of truth for launching both the CLI and the Streamlit UI, making it easier to add new interfaces or commands in the future. 

The RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system has seen significant progress with the implementation of core graph nodes and workflow. The RAG modules now provide a robust foundation for question answering based on document context, with comprehensive test coverage and detailed performance metrics. The implementation follows best practices with proper error handling, logging, and a clear separation of concerns. With the graph structure in place, the system is ready for integration into the CLI and UI interfaces, which will provide users with powerful document-based question answering capabilities. 

The graph-based workflow architecture is proven and ready for enhancement with additional node types and capabilities beyond the RAG implementation.
